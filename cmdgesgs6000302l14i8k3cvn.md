As long as I can remember, I’ve externalized my todos.

Starting with a humble list on a piece of paper, I’ve dabbled with [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), [Hipster PDAs](https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda), [Zen to Done](https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/), [Bullet Journals](https://bulletjournal.com/), and [other systems](https://lifehacker.com/strikethru-makes-paper-productive-by-combining-gtd-and-1744582416).

Along the way, I’ve tailored and tweaked, looking for just enough structure, preferring pen and paper when possible, and using digital tools where they add unique value (primarily sharing and scheduling).

My most recent iteration has served me for about four years, and while there is no one productivity system to rule them all, this one has shown its scalability and stability over the years and seems worth documenting.

For easier consumption (and writing), this will be a multi-part series:

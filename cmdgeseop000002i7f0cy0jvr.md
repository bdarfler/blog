*This is an update to* [*My Analog Productivity System for 2023*](https://bdarfler.medium.com/my-analog-productivity-system-87ba02418904) *which is one part of a multi-part series on* [*how I get things done*](https://bdarfler.medium.com/how-i-get-things-done-ac3e229e4463)

At the start of the year, I wrote a three part series on [how I get things done](https://bdarfler.medium.com/how-i-get-things-done-ac3e229e4463). That system is the culmination of years of iteration, and much of it remains very stable. However, over the past year, I made some small refinements to my analog productivity system.

In the past two years, my meeting load increased as I moved into a Director of Engineering role and my organization tripled in size. As I mentioned in the initial post, I’m a big fan of the [got-done list](https://www.wired.com/story/productivity-got-done-list/) to build a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. With more time for meetings and less time for tasks, I was starting to miss that experience.

At the same time, I had rediscovered [rapid logging](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers) and was curious to try it out. Documenting the day as it happens, including events, felt powerful. However, to make room for this experiment, I had to change up my weekly spread.

Layout wise, compared to the [previous version](https://bdarfler.medium.com/my-analog-productivity-system-87ba02418904), I moved the projects section to the left side to make more space for the [daily log](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/how-to-write-a-daily-log) on the right side. Additionally, since no two days are the same, I now let each day take up as much space as it needs.

Process wise, I now start each day by writing down the meetings for the day (denoted by the `O` symbol). I am still a big fan of daily [most important tasks](https://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/) and I write those down next. Finally, as I move through the day, I’ll capture more events and tasks as I go.

I’ve been using this approach for most of a year, and I appreciate having a better accounting of my time. This, lets me reflect on where I spend my time and keeps that sense of accomplishment and satisfaction going.

Finally, for the careful observer, you may have noticed I changed up my pen. I’m now using a [Pilot Explorer Pen](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-explorer-fountain-pens) with a fine nib as my daily driver. I do still use my [Pilot Kakuno Pen](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-kakuno-fountain-pens) with a medium nib for the page structure.

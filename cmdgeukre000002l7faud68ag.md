Newsletters? Really? 2014 is a few months away, and yet I’m talking about newsletters like its 1998? Didn’t RSS kill newsletters and [Twitter supplant RSS](http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/06/twitter-search-discovery/)? Well, that is certainly the prevailing thinking. However, there is a retro trend cropping up, technology email newsletters, and its quickly becoming the primary way in which I find interesting articles online.

The trend seems to have started in August 2010 when [Peter Cooper](https://twitter.com/peterc) first published [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/). Back in those days [Ruby 1.8.7](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/05/31/ruby-1-8-7-has-been-released/) was still shiny and new and [Rails 3.0](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/8/29/rails-3-0-it-s-done/) had only just been released on the world. Since then, Peter has slowly added newsletter after newsletter, finally reaching a total of 6 newsletters under the [Cooper Press](https://cooperpress.com/) banner. Many others, including [Rahul Chaudhary](https://twitter.com/rahulgchaudhary), have taken inspiration from Peter and started their own newsletters. So, without further ado, here is a complete listing of newsletters you should know about as of October 2013.

#### Management and Leadership

#### [Technology & Leadership News](http://www.techleadershipnews.com/)

An incredible wealth of knowledge from [Kate Matsudaira](https://twitter.com/katemats) and [Kate Stull](https://twitter.com/katestull) spanning technology, product, leadership, management and anything else interesting from the week. Probably the single most interesting and comprehensive newsletter of the bunch. If you enjoy the content then I highly recommend checking out their latest project over at [https://popforms.com/](https://popforms.com/).

#### [Agile Weekly](http://agileweekly.com/)

A focused newsletter on agile development with a eye towards productivity and team leadership. Well worth the read, as well as the [podcast](http://integrumtech.com/category/agile-weekly-podcast/) run by the same folks.

#### [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/)

A great compliment to the Agile Weekly newsletter with links focused on team building and leadership.
